## üì¢ Setting Up a Discord Webhook
1. Open **Discord** and go to your server settings.
2. Navigate to **Integrations > Webhooks**.
3. Create a new webhook and copy the **Webhook URL**.
4. Use this URL with `Discord-Uploader` to send messages.

For a detailed guide, see: [How to Create a Discord Webhook](https://techwiser.com/create-discord-webhook-send-message/).

## ‚ùó Limitations
- **Maximum file size:** Discord allows files up to **8MB** for free users.
- **Rate limits:** Discord enforces webhook rate limits (5 requests per second).
- **Currently, only Linux supports the easy install.** Windows/macOS support is planned.

## üõ† Troubleshooting
### "Webhook is required" error
Ensure you provide a valid webhook URL using `--webhook`.

### "File not found" error
Check that the file path is correct and that the file exists.

### "JSON format error"
Ensure the JSON string is properly formatted. Test it with a JSON validator.
